<h2> <code>mherit</code> R Package</h2>

I'm currently working on an R package called <code>mherit</code>, which will facilitate calculating the heritability of 16S rRNA amplicon microbiome datasets, similar to what was done in [Goodrich <i>et al.</i> (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012410) and [Goodrich <i>et al.</i> (2016)](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(16)30153-6). You can check it out [here](https://danielsprockett.github.io/mherit/).
